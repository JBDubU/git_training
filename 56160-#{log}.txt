3.08 56160 jw420k 10.1.15- changed log button to just #{Log} in nodes

Issue:
We are refactoring how we display logs, we are making it such that the ticket logs iframe will only display when a button is pressed.  This should make flows load more quickly.  However, because we do not consistently display ticket logs - very often we hide it already behind a button - we need to modify existing locations we are calling the #{Log} variable so that the UA doesn't have to put a button twice to display ticket logs

Solution:
The following flows have been identified as being potential workflows with the #{Log} variable being hidden behind a "show logs" button.  Modify each node currently displaying the log variable behind a "show logs" button (so it will be in a hidden div, a hidden table, or similar), such that the only thing display is simply the #{Log} variable.
